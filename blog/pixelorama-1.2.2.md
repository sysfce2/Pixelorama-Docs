Greetings everyone! We have another Pixelorama update for you! Today we are releasing version 1.2.2 to the world, and with it we bring a highly requested feature, a new dedicated **gradient tool**! Not only that, but you can now also export Pixelorama projects as Aseprite files, instead of just being able to import them.

We also fixed a quite serious bug, which made keyframe IDs conflicting with already existing keyframes when loading a pxo file. If you load a pxo file that has keyframes, you will unfortunately need to re-create them in order for it to work correctly, otherwise when you try to select, move, delete etc a keyframe, other keyframes will also receive the same operation, due to ID conflicts. Moreover, we re-wrote some of the code of the layer effect system to massively improve the performance of stacked effects.
